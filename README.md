# Okimarchy

Compatibility: Okimarchy is now compatible with Omarchy 3

**Okimarchy** is an *okimari* flavor of arch forked from Omarchy.
This transforms Omarchy from an *omakase* (chef's choice) to an *okimari* (pre-set menu) approach:
- **Omakase**: Trust the chef completely (original Omarchy with Hyprland only)
- **Okimari**: Choose from carefully curated options (Okimarchy with Hyprland or Niri)

## Key Features

- **Dual Window Manager Support**: Users can now choose between Hyprland and Niri during installation. Both WMs can be installed simultaneously.
- **Runtime Switching**: Switch between window managers after installation via the Omarchy Menu (*Omarchy Menu (Mod+Alt+Space) -> Setup -> Window Manager*) or `okimarchy-wm-switch` command
- **Consistent Theming**: Niri configurations for all existing themes (Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Nord, Tokyo Night, etc.)
- **Unified Keybindings**: Niri configured to match Hyprland's keybindings and behavior
- Niri is configured to look and feel similar to Hyprland and to follow the Omarchy philosophy.

**Configuration System:**
- Modular Niri configuration files (`bindings.kdl`, `layout.kdl`, `windows.kdl`, etc.) and a dynamic Niri configuration generator (`omarchy-niri-config-gen`)
- Theme-specific Niri configurations for all existing themes
